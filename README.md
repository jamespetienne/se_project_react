# WTWR - What To Wear

## Project Overview

In this project, we created and styled the components that make up the front end of the “WTWR” app. The app provides users with clothing recommendations based on the current weather. Here's an overview of the features implemented in this iteration:

- A set of clothing cards generated from a hard-coded array of data.
- A call to the weather API when a user visits the site, parsing the response to save the current temperature and location name as a React state.
- Displaying the current location in the header, based on predefined coordinates.
- Showing the current temperature (in Fahrenheit) on the weather card, which is used to filter the clothing cards shown to the user.
- Ability to open and close the new garment modal.
- Displaying an image modal when a clothing card is clicked.

Future iterations will add more functionality such as adding, liking, or deleting items, and logging in.
